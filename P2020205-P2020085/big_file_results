Data received through pipe CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN WAS DEVELOPED BY AMERICAN PROGRAMMER SILAS WARNER, ALONG WITH DALE GRAY AND GEORGE VARNDELL, AND PUBLISHED IN 1981 BY HIS COMPANY M.U.S.E. INC. (LATER KNOWN AS MUSE SOFTWARE).[2] WARNER IS CITED AS A PIONEER IN THE EARLY ERAS OF VIDEO GAMING, ESPECIALLY IN THE STEALTH GENRE.[3][4]
Data received through pipe 
Data received through pipe CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN WAS INITIALLY CONCEPTUALIZED BY WARNER AFTER HE SAW THE 1961 BRITISH-AMERICAN WAR FILM THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, WHICH FOLLOWS THE EFFORTS OF AN ALLIED COMMANDO UNIT AS THEY ATTEMPT TO DESTROY A SEEMINGLY IMPREGNABLE GERMAN FORTRESS.[5][6] THAT SAME DAY WARNER, PLAYED THE MULTI-DIRECTIONAL SHOOTER ARCADE GAME, BERZERK, IN WHICH THE PLAYER NAVIGATES THROUGH A MAZE WITH LASER-SHOOTING ROBOTS.[7] AFTER PLAYING THE GAME, WARNER THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING THE DESIGN OF BERZERK AND REPLACING THE ROBOTS WITH NAZIS.[8] HE EVENTUALLY SETTLED ON THE IDEA OF A GAME BASED ON THE ARCADE SHOOT 'EM UP GENRE, WHERE PLAYERS DODGE ENEMIES WITH THE INTENT OF KILLING THEM, BUT INSTEAD CHANGING THE OBJECTIVE TO ESCAPE THE ENEMY GUARDS AND THEIR CASTLE, NOT NECESSARILY TO KILL AND DESTROY THEM; THIS MADE SHOOTING GUARDS SIMPLY A MEANS TO AN END AND NOT AN END IN ITSELF.[6]

Data received through pipe CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN IS OFTEN CREDITED AS ONE OF THE FIRST VIDEO GAMES IN THE STEALTH GENRE, AS IT FOCUSES MORE ON AVOIDING OR DISARMING ENEMIES, AND KILLING THEM IS CONSIDERED A LAST RESORT.[9] CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN WAS ALSO THE FIRST COMPUTER GAME TO FEATURE DIGITIZED SPEECH[10] AND INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SIMILAR GAME FRANCHISES SUCH AS METAL GEAR AND THIEF.[11] MUSE SOFTWARE RELEASED THE FOLLOW-UP, BEYOND CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN IN 1984 BEFORE THE COMPANY LEGALLY DISESTABLISHED ON OCTOBER 7, 1987.[12]

Data received through pipe IN NOVEMBER 1991, THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT COMPANY ID SOFTWARE, FOUNDED BY PROGRAMMERS JOHN CARMACK AND JOHN ROMERO, GAME DESIGNER TOM HALL, AND ARTIST ADRIAN CARMACK, WERE PLANNING THEIR NEXT MAJOR GAME AFTER FINISHING THEIR CONTRACT WITH THEIR FORMER EMPLOYER SOFTDISK.[13] AFTER AN INITIAL SUGGESTION FOR A SCI-FI GAME BY HALL TITLED "IT'S GREEN AND PISSED", ABOUT FIGHTING MUTANTS IN A RESEARCH LAB, ROMERO PROPOSED A 3D REMAKE OF CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN. THE TEAM GRAVITATED TO THE IDEA AS HALL, ROMERO, AND JOHN CARMACK HAD ALL ENJOYED PLAYING THE 1981 ORIGINAL.[14] THE TEAM INITIALLY BELIEVED THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE THE NAME BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT ISSUES; HOWEVER THEY FOUND THAT THE TRADEMARK HAD ALREADY LAPSED BY 1986.[15]

Data received through pipe PRODUCTION FOR WOLFENSTEIN 3D BEGAN ON DECEMBER 15, 1991.[16] ROMERO PITCHED THE IDEA AS A 3D VERSION OF CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN AND THE TEAM INITIALLY PLANNED TO INCLUDE MANY OF THE SAME FEATURES THAT CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN AND ITS SEQUEL HAD INCLUDED SUCH AS DRAGGING AND LOOTING DEAD BODIES, AND OPENING CRATES. THEY ALSO BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT OTHER IDEAS INSPIRED BY THE STEALTH ASPECT OF CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN SUCH AS SWAPPING UNIFORMS WITH GUARDS, AND STEALTH ATTACKING ENEMIES; THE TEAM WAS ALSO ABLE TO GET IT WORKING SO IF A GUARD SAW A DEAD BODY THEY TRIED FINDING THE PLAYER.[8][15] HOWEVER, THE STEALTH RELATED FEATURES WERE EVENTUALLY REMOVED AS ROMERO FOUND THAT THEY IMPEDED THE FLOW OF THE GAME; ROMERO STATED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT "THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE GAME CAME TO A DEAD STOP WHEN YOU DID THESE THINGS... WE DIDN'T WANT TO SLOW IT DOWN SO WE ACTUALLY REMOVED THE FEATURES AND LEFT IT FAST." AS ROMERO FURTHER EXPLAINED IN ANOTHER INTERVIEW: "THE GAME WAS MOST FUN WHEN IT WAS A BREAKNECK RUN THROUGH MAPS WITH TONS OF BLASTING DOWN NAZIS. ANYTHING THAT SLOWED DOWN THAT GAMEPLAY HAD TO GO."[17]

Data received through pipe ID'S WOLFENSTEIN 3D WAS RELEASED ON MAY 5, 1992 AND PUBLISHED BY APOGEE SOFTWARE.[15] THE GAME HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH HELPING TO ESTABLISH THE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER GENRE,[11][18] AND MARKED A NEW DIRECTION FOR THE FRANCHISE ITSELF. 3D WAS THE FIRST GAME TO FEATURE A FIRST-PERSON VIEW AND 3D GRAPHICS, BREAKING AWAY FROM THE MORE RESERVED GAMEPLAY OF CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN THAT VALUED STEALTH AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. THE GAME INSTEAD ADAPTED THE RUN AND GUN STYLE THAT WOULD SET THE TEMPLATE FOR THE FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER GENRE.[11] WOLFENSTEIN 3D WAS ALSO THE FIRST GAME TO FEATURE WILLIAM "B.J." BLAZKOWICZ, AN AMERICAN SPY OF POLISH DESCENT, WHO WOULD BECOME THE MAIN PROTAGONIST OF THE SERIES.[19]
